microKorg
=========

This is a Max application for better control of the microKorg

This patch hasn't been touched at all for years, as I don't have a microKORG anymore.
I just recently went ahead and gathered it to put it up on my website as an open source thingie.
It is very possibly broken. I tried it in max5 and it looked alright. Max6 messed the whole look up, though, but the connections and the logic should be solid.

If you can work this thing out and improve it possibly, please do. I would love you to keep me posted on how it goes and possibly send me updates if you manage to improve this program and let me share new versions of this so more people can gain from it. You will of course get full credit for your improvements and the patch will remain open source and free forever.

Does that sound alright to you?

Cool beans!

All the best,
