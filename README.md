microKorg
=========

This is a Max application for better control of the microKorg

This patch hasn't been touched at all for years, as I don't have a microKORG anymore.
I just recently went ahead and gathered it to put it up on my website as an open source thingie.
It is very possibly broken. I tried it in max5 and it looked alright. Max6 messed the whole look up, though, but the connections and the logic should be solid.

If you can work this thing out and improve it possibly, please do. I'd love nothing more than to approve some pull requests.

Cool beans!
